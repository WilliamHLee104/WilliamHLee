I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in Mathematical Economics and a Minor in Statistics in 2019. While at Penn, I worked as a Research Assistant for Marja Hoek-Smik at [HOFINET](http://hofinet.org) (Housing Finance Information Network). I was also active in [Wharton Public Policy Initiative: Student Group](https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/for-students/student-group/). 

After graduation, I joined the [Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago](https://www.chicagofed.org/) as a Research Assistant in the [Finance Group](https://www.chicagofed.org/people/person-listing?filter_team=5). In addition to policy work, I focus on household finance, housing markets, and intergenerational mobility.
